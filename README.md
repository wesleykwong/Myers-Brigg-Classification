# Myers-Brigg Personality Classification with Twitter Feed

This is the repo for Wesley Kwong's 5th Year MIDS W266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning final project.

The aim of this project was to analyze how various monolingual and multilingual BERT models performed on classifying the Myers-Brigg Personality Test (MBTI) classes based on Twitter tweets. The dataset used for this project was the TwiSty dataset. The four languages examined are German (DE), Spanish (ES), Italian (IT), and Dutch (NL).
